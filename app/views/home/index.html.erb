		<p>I was frustrated using any of the calendar programs for planning when to book lessons. 
		They all show me the dates and times of my lessons, but I wanted a visual representation
		of the timing of lessons and competitions, <em>including the time between them</em></p>
		
		<p>I wrote this site for me. It solves a problem that I have. However I decided
			to open it for anyone to use - for free. 	</div>
